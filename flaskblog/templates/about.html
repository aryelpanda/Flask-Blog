<h1>About the Flask Blog Project</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This personal project blog is built using the Flask web framework and demonstrates how to apply web development
        skills to create a dynamic and interactive application. The project leverages a wide variety of libraries to
        enhance functionality, enabling features such as user management, post creation, and content organization.</p>
    <p>Flask, known for being lightweight and flexible, allowed for quick setup while providing room for future
        scalability. The focus of this project is to showcase a clean and structured interface, making it an ideal
        platform for personal content management and user interaction.</p>

    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
    <h3>Architecture and Design</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Modular package-style architecture for improved scalability</li>
        <li>Use of Flask Blueprints for organized and maintainable code structure</li>
        <li>Implementation of a configuration file (config.py) for easier unit testing</li>
        <li>Made an code documnetation example.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Frontend</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Utilization of Jinja2 templating engine for dynamic HTML generation</li>
        <li>Integration of Bootstrap for responsive design and consistent styling</li>
        <li>Implementation of forms using WTForms for streamlined data handling</li>
        <li>Use of Bootstrap classes for navigation, ensuring responsiveness on smaller screens</li>
        <li>Utilization of for loops in HTML templates to present post data dynamically</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Backend</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SQLAlchemy ORM for database management, initially using SQLite</li>
        <li>Implementation of user-post relationships in the database model</li>
        <li>Password encryption using bcrypt for enhanced security</li>
        <li>Use of tokens for secure password reset functionality</li>
        <li>Implementation of remember-me feature using secure cookies</li>
        <li>Utilization of POST and GET requests for form handling and data validation</li>
        <li>Implementation of a mail server with internal username and password for email functionality</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Security and Best Practices</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Form validation using WTForms validators to ensure data integrity</li>
        <li>Password Hashing: All passwords are hashed using bcrypt, ensuring that sensitive information is never stored
            in plain text.</li>
        <li>Token-Based Password Recovery: The password reset functionality uses time-limited tokens generated by
            itsdangerous, enhancing security by ensuring tokens expire after a set period.</li>
        <li>CSRF protection for forms to prevent cross-site request forgery</li>
        <li>Authentication Control: flask_login is used to manage user sessions and ensure that sensitive actions (like
            updating account details) are performed by authenticated users only.</li>
        <li>Use of secret key/token protection against cookie modification</li>
        <li>Implementation of user-specific access controls (e.g., preventing users from deleting posts they don't own)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Database Design</h2>
    <p>The project uses SQLAlchemy as an ORM to interact with a SQLite database. Key aspects of the database design
        include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User model with relationships to posts</li>
        <li>Post model with a many-to-one relationship with users (one user can have many posts)</li>
        <li>Efficient data retrieval using SQLAlchemy's lazy loading feature</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Deployment</h2>
    <p>The application is deployed on a Linux server, utilizing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nginx as a reverse proxy</li>
        <li>Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP server</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This setup ensures robust and efficient serving of the Flask application in a production environment.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Resolved circular import issues by restructuring the application as a package</li>
        <li>Addressed database locking issues during user registration by configuring antivirus software</li>
        <li>Overcame email server configuration challenges for the password reset feature</li>
        <li>Implemented proper error handling and custom error pages for various scenarios</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
    <p>This project serves as a foundation for further development. Potential future enhancements could include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Additional blog features such as commenting systems or tag categorization</li>
        <li>Performance optimizations for handling larger amounts of data</li>
        <li>Integration with third-party services to expand functionality</li>
        <li>Implementation of more advanced security features</li>
    </ul>
